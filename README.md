# Steps: Milestone 1
- Begin in the "scripts -> data_preprocessing"
- Once preprocessing is complete, "scripts -> eda" to conduct eda
- Process data, master and individually
- Remove null values, and symbols in the data
- Merge data for master file
- Begin EDA, remove outliers first, then create graphs.

# Steps: Milestone 2
- Begin in "scripts -> feature_engineering_and_model_building"
- Process data, master and individually for each model
- Create new features depending on existing features and outcome
- Develop models and hypertune to get better results
- Conduct dimensionality reduction to see if results improve
- Compare results and determine best model
- Note: check utils_info.md and hyper_utils_info.md files for information on the functions used on datasets for preprocessing, analyzing models and hypertuning.

# Steps Milestone 3
- Begin in the "scripts -> dashboard"
- Download all files in the folder
- Start by loading the .csv files in the data folder
- "dashboard_prediction" containes files for property price prediction
- "app_visualizations.py" is the code for the plots/visualizations
